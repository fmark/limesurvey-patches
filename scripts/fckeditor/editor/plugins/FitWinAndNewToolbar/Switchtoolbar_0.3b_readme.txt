1. INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

 1.1. Unpack the contents of the archive to your FCKeditor plugins directory.
 1.2. Open your FCKeditor config file (default or custom) and add the following lines:

      FCKConfig.Plugins.Add('Switchtoolbar', 'en,ru,uk');
      // *** The Switchtoolbar cycle toolbars. These are not checked, so
      // * if you specify an invalid toolbar, the editor will crash
      FCKConfig.SwitchtoolbarCycle = ['Default','Basic'];

 1.3. Add the 'Switchtoolbar' button to all the toolbars, that you are going to use in the
      cycle. It might be a nice idea to place the button in the same spot, so the user can
      cycle several toolbars without any mouse movement

 1.4. Done! Load the editor and enjoy the plugin! Any notes and suggestions are most welcome.

2. LANGUAGES

 There isn't much to translate there, so the language shouldn't be a problem. Still, I've
 included three language files with the plugin: English, Russian, Ukrainian. If you are
 planning to add your own language, be sure to mention it in the FCKConfig.Plugins.Add()
 command.
