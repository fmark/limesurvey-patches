Welcome to LimeSurvey v1.49RC!

Warning:
THIS IS AN RELEASE CANDIDATE. It should be pretty stable, but it SHOULD NOT be used FOR PRODUCTION!
IF YOU DO SO, YOU DO IT (as always) AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This release does have the following requirements:

-MySQL 4.1 or higher
-PHP 4.2 or higher 
-mbstring library installed. (for localizations)


HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
If you are doing a complete new installation please refer to the manual at
http://docs.limesurvey.org



=== UPGRADING=====

HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions of LimeSurvey (<1.08)
-------------------------------------------------------------
We are sorry but you can't upgrade from versions <= 1.0.8. Seriously! 
The database structure has changed that much it wouldn't be feasible.
However, you can import old surveys from version 1.0 when you create a new survey in this new version.
Just do a new installation as described on http://docs.limesurvey.org.


HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions from LimeSurvey 1.45 or later
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files and database.
2. Backup your config.php.
3. Delete all old files 
4. Upload the new version to the same place
5. Adjust the settings in config.php to the setting from the backup config.php. Do NOT just copy over the old config.php over the new one.
6. Run the installer in /admin/install.php to update the database
7. Done.





Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!

=========================

1.) New question types

* List type question divided into two question types - radio 
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by 
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a 
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing 
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together. 
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully.

and working of individual questions - for example:

    - Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
    - Set a maximum character length on text questions
    - Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
    - Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and huge free text
