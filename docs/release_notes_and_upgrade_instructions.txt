Welcome to PHPSurveyor!

HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
If you are doing a complete new installation please refer to the manual at
/admin/manual.html.


HOW TO UPGRADE from all earlier versions of PHPSurveyor
-------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Before you upgrade READ THIS:

PHPSurveyor has been converted to UTF-8. That means that existing surveys 
using an non-alphabetic (A..Z) charset like japanese or kyrillic WILL HAVE 
TO be redone!

If you have surveys in a such a language you will have to take the 
pain and do this.

There is no safe way around this (The only way might be an export of the database
and editing the SQL file with an UTF-8 capable editor - but we never tried that.)

The advantage on the other hand is that in this new version of PHPSurveyor you can 
have your admin interface in russian but write chinese surveys for example - 
and even mix it. You can use any writable char of any language without messing up 
anything. No future language changes in PHPSurveyor will be necessary, new 
languages will be supported out of the box.

Ready to upgrade?

The upgrade procedure step-by-step:

1.)	Make a full backup of your PHPSurveyor database just in case!

2.)	Make a full backup of your PHPSurveyor directory 
	(especially the the file admin/config.php for reference)!

3.)	Delete all files from your PHPSurveyor directory.

4.)	Upload the new files into your PHPSurveyor directory.

5.)	Edit the config.php to match your existing database setup... 
	Do NOT just copy over the old config.php!

6.)	Run the admin/admin.php as usual!

7.)	Do a database check. Click on the brown container icon in the admin bar, 
	then execute the database check. This will generate missing tables and/or fields.

8.)	There are new template files required for this release. If you 
    	have any templates you have created yourself, you need to 
	ensure that they have a copy of the "assessments.pstpl", 
	"save.pstpl" and "load.pstpl" templates in their directory. The 
	templates admin screen will automatically copy the default 
	version of these files into any template folder it views if they do 
	not already exist.

=========================

1.) New question types

* List type question divided into two question types - radio 
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by 
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a 
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing 
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together. 
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully. 
  READ THE STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE!!!!

and working of individual questions - for example:

	- Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
	- Set a maximum character length on text questions
	- Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
	- Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and huge free text
