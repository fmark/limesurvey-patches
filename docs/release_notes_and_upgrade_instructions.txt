Welcome to PHPSurveyor!

Warning:
THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. IT SHOULD NO BET USED FOR PRODUCTION!
IF YOU DO SO, YOU DO IT (as always) AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This release does have the following requirement:

-MySQL 4.1 or higher
-PHP 4.1 or higher with deactivated SAFE_MODE (which is a pretty standard setting)
-mbstring library installed. (for localizations)


HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
If you are doing a complete new installation please refer to the manual at
http://docs.phpsurveyor.org



HOW TO UPGRADE from all earlier versions of PHPSurveyor
-------------------------------------------------------
You can't upgrade. Serious! The database structure has changed that much it wouldn't be feasible.

However you can import surveys from version 1.0 when you create a new survey in this new version.

Just do a new installation as described on http://docs.phpsurveyor.org.




Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!

* List type question divided into two question types - radio 
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by 
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a 
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing 
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together. 
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully.
