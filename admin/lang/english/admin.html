Click on
<img border="0" src="../../images/add.gif" width="20" height="20"> to create or 
import a new survey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">The 'add new survey' screen 
allows you to complete the basic details of your survey, as well as choose a 
number of presentation options, and general options. From this screen you can 
also import a survey exported previously.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">Survey details include a <b>Short 
Title</b>: which is the short name of your survey, a <b>Description</b>: which 
is a detailed description of your survey and can be as long as you like, a <b>
Welcome Message</b>: which is presented at the very beginning of surveys, the 
self-explanatory <b>Administrator Name</b> and <b>Admin Email</b> fields which 
are used to direct participants to the appropriate person with questions about 
the survey and are also used as the reply-to address when sending email 
invitations to your survey, a <b>Fax To</b>: field, which allows you to enter a 
fax number which will appear on your 'printable' survey, a <b>URL</b>: which 
will be presented at the end of the survey so you can direct participants to a 
web site of your choice after completing the survey, and a <b>URL Description</b>: 
which is the text to which the URL is attached.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">The presentation options are <b>
Format</b>: which lets you choose whether your survey will be presented as all 
questions in a single page, questions displayed by group, or questions displayed 
one web page at a time, <b>Template</b>: which gives you a list of pre-defined 
templates that set the look and feel of your survey, and <b>Language</b>: which 
lets you choose from any pre-existing language files for built-in answers and 
messages such as &quot;Yes/No&quot;, &quot;Male/Female&quot; and so on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">Finally, there are a couple of 
additional general options to choose from. By default your survey will be <b>
Anonymous</b>, however you can choose to make a survey Not Anonymous, which 
means that the responses are linked to your tokens table, and you can trace 
individual answers to a particular respondent. <b>Date Stamp</b>: lets you add a 
time/date entry to every response so you can keep a record with each 
participants response of when they completed the survey. The <b>Expiry Date</b>: 
is the date at which your survey will cease to be publicly available. If you 
leave this field blank, the survey will never expire. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">The option <b>Use Cookies?</b> 
allows you to set some basic access controls over your survey if you are not 
using tokens. Setting this to 'Y' means that when a participant successfully 
submits their survey responses, a cookie is saved to their computer indicating 
that they have done so. The next time they attempt to complete the survey using 
the same computer they will not be able to do so. It should be noted that this 
is fairly basic, and not particularly clever access control. If two different 
people want to complete the survey using the same computer, this method will 
preclude them from doing so - only the first will be able to. If one person 
tries to complete the survey twice, but on different computers, they <u>will</u> be 
able to do so. So you should be aware of these issues before applying this 
option. It is helpful to provide some impediments to multiple responses by the 
same person but certainly not a foolproof solution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt"><b>Importing a Survey</b><br>
You can use the file menu at the bottom of the screen to import a survey. Click 
on browse, choose the PHPSurveyor *.sql file containing your survey and then 
click on the Import button.</font></p>
