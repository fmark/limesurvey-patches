<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: 700">You are currently viewing the
<u>User Control</u> section of PHPSurveyor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">From this point you can view and 
edit the security settings and user access rights for your script.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">PHPSurveyor security settings 
rely on the Apache directory security system. If you are not using the Apache 
web surver, you cannot use these security settings and you should initialise 
directory security using your servers standard methods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font style="font-size: 8pt"><u><b>Initialising Security<br>
</b></u>The first time you run security from PHPSurveyor, it will 'initialise' 
the security settings. When it 'initialises', the script finds the Apache &quot;htpasswd&quot; 
executable file and creates a 'user' file. It also creates a 'htaccess' file in 
your admin directory that restricts access to the admin directory to only those 
users in the htpasswd file. The initial username and password are determined by 
the 'default' settings in your config.php file. Once you have initialised 
security succesfully, your browser will ask for this username and password 
before allowing you to continue using the administration scripts of PHPSurveyor.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt"><u><b>Adding Users</b></u><br>
Once you have initialised security and 'logged in', you will be able to view the 
existing users on your system, add new users, delete users or modify users. This 
is fairly straight forward. In the list of users that displays, click on the 
&quot;edit&quot; button to modify an entry, or the &quot;del&quot; button to delete it. If there is 
only one entry in the user table you will not be able to delete that.</font></p>

Turning Off Security<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">To turn off PHPSurveyors 
security settings, click on the &quot;Turn Off Security&quot; button. This will delete the 
htpasswd, htaccess file and all user information from the directories.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt"><u><b>Limitations of PHPSurveyor 
Security</b></u><br>
Until a more flexible security system is implemented, it should be remembered 
that the PHPSurveyor security settings are an 'all-or-nothing' affair. Users 
either have access to ALL administration functions, or they have none. 
Eventually a system is planned that allows you to set levels of access. Note 
especially that the user security feature is accessible to all users, including 
the PLAIN-TEXT PASSWORDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt"><u><b>Troubleshooting</b></u><br>
If you are having trouble setting up security:</font></p>
<ol style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 8pt">
  <li><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">Make sure you have read/write 
  permissions in the admin directory. PHPSurveyor needs to be able to create a .htpasswd 
  and .htaccess file here.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" style="font-size: 8pt">Make sure you have access to 
  the htpasswd executable file. On windows servers in particular, a copy of this 
  will almost certainly need to be placed in the /phpsurveyor/admin directory 
  along with the other scripts. On Linux servers, the script will attempt to 
  find the htpasswd executable using &quot;find&quot;.</font></li>
</ol>
