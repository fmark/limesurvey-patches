// === Basic Setup

$databasetype       =   "mysql";       // ADOdb database driver - either mysql or odbc_mssql
$databaselocation   =   "localhost";     // Network location of your Database - for odbc_mssql use the mssql servername, not localhost or IP
$databaseport       =   "default";     // The port of your Database - if you use a standard port leave on default
$databasename       =   "phpsurveyor"; // The name of the database that we will create
$databaseuser       =   "root";        // The name of a user with rights to create db (or if db already exists, then rights within that db)
$databasepass       =   "";            // Password of db user
$dbprefix           =   "phpsv_";      // A global prefix that can be added to all PHPSurveyor tables. Use this if you are sharing
                                       // a database with other applications. Suggested prefix is "phpsv_"

$useidprefix        =   0;             // Set this to 1 if you want to use a prefix on survey responses (useful for replicated/pooled databases)
$idprefix           =   0;             // Leave this as 0 to use your server's IP address. Alternatively, use a number here - characters WILL NOT WORK.

// FILE LOCATIONS
$rooturl            =   "http://{$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']}/phpsurveyor"; //The root web url for your phpsurveyor installation. 

$rootdir            =   dirname(__FILE__); // This is the physical disk location for your phpsurveyor installation. Normally you don't have to touch this setting.
                                           // If you use IIS then you MUST enter the complete rootdir e.g. : $rootDir="C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\phpsurveyor"!
                                           // Some IIS installations also require to use forward slashes instead of backslashes, e.g.  $rootDir="C:/Inetpub/wwwroot/phpsurveyor"!
                                           // If you use OS/2 this must be the complete rootdir with FORWARD slashes e.g.: $rootDir="c:/phpsurveyor";!

                            // If you notice that labels are not being translated like "_ADMINISTRATION_" instead of "Administration"
                            // then try setting this to 1 .

// === Advanced Setup

                                          // Note: For OS/2 the $tempdir may need to be defined as an actual directory
                                          // example: "x:/phpsurveyor/tmp". We don't know why.

// Site Info

                                          // smtp      -  use SMTP relaying

$emailsmtphost      =   "localhost";    // Sets the SMTP host. All hosts must be separated by a semicolon.
                                                // You can also specify a different port for each host by using

$maxemails          =   50;              // The maximum number of emails to send in one go (this is to prevent your mail server or script from timeouting when sending mass mail)

// JPGRAPH Settings
// To use jpgraph you must install and set up jpgraph, available from http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/
// PHPSurveyor has been tested using version 1.13. Documentation for this is available at the
// jpgraph website. PHPSurveyor cannot assist in the setting up of this system.
// To use JPGraph adjust the next two lines, and adjust the location as suites.
$usejpgraph         =   1; //Set to 1 to enable

// CMS Integration Settings
// Set $embedded to true and specify the header and footer functions if the survey is to be displayed embedded in a CMS
$embedded = false;
$embedded_inc = "";             // path to the header to include if any
